#Unzip fastq files of raw sequences
gunzip Cliona_*.fastq.gz 
 

#####to count reads you will see an @ line for each read - it will start with some letter designation, just use that, in this case: @A0
#####then the cat - grep - wc pipe line should tell you the number of reads in each of the files of interest. 

cat yourfilename.fastq | grep @A0 | wc -l

Ex) cat Cliona_1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq | grep @A0 | wc -l     #10,581,948
Ex) cat Cliona_1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq | grep @A0 | wc -l     #10,581,948

#####Cliona - #104,183,967# (lane 1, R1); #104,889,814# (lane 1, R2)
#####there will also be ones for R2 lanes 1 and 2 I, I just did not note them here
